# MTG_color_pie_clustering
Final project for the course "Introduction to Machine Learning"
The idea is to embed cards in a vector space using semantic info of their text and name (and maybe more, like card type ecc) to then apply some clustering algorithm and see if clusters found this way follow the color identity of the cards
